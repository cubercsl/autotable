# Autotable Cubercsl Fork

This is a fork of riichinomics fork and the original autotable project. Extra features include:
* Washizu mode
* Face down discarding for yami mahjong
* Spectator mode
* Room passwords for spectating and playing
* Some minor bug fixes
* Backpork upstream unseat function


The documentation below is somewhat out of date, but you can still get the project running locally with make as described.

# Autotable

Autotable is a tabletop simulator for Riichi Mahjong.

* Game: https://cubercsl.cn/autotable
* About page: https://cubercsl.cn/autotable/about.html
* Blog post: https://pwmarcz.pl/blog/autotable/

## Running

This repository uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to track large files. To clone all files, you need to install it first.

You need the following utilities installed and present in `PATH`:

* GNU make
* node and yarn
* Inkscape 1.0+ (for textures: .svg -> .png conversion)
* Blender (for 3D models: .blend -> .glb conversion)

Run:

* `yarn` to install frontend packages
* `cd server && yarn` to install server packages
* `make parcel` to run and serve frontend
* `make files` to re-generate static files (textures and models)
* `make server` to run server
* `make test` to run server tests

## Deployment

The frontend can be served as static files. Run `make build`.

The server is a WebSocket application. You can run it on the server listening on localhost, and use your HTTP server to expose it to the world.

By default, the frontend should be under `/autotable/` and server under `/autotable/ws`.

Here is what I use for nginx:

    location /autotable/ {
        expires 0d;
        alias <path_to_autotable>/dist/;
    }

    location /autotable/ws {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1235/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # Prevent dropping idle connections
        proxy_read_timeout 7d;
    }

## Contributions

This is a very opinionated project. I will be grateful for contributions that fix bugs or improve player experience. However, I will probably not want to merge any of:

* Making the engine **too general**, at the cost of simplicity. I'm not interested in a general-purpose tabletop engine.
* Other mahjong **variants** than Riichi Mahjong, unless it has a low maintenance cost. Same reason as above - I would rather have a great support for Riichi than mediocre support for all kinds of mahjong.
* Any form of **automation**, such as automatic tile drawing, sorting, scoring etc. This is contrary to the project's philosophy.

However, please don't feel discouraged from making these changes in your own fork! While I want to do my thing here, I would be very interested to see in what directions people take the project.

## Development

See the blog post for explanation of many technical decisions: https://pwmarcz.pl/blog/autotable/

The main parts are:

* `Game` - main class, connecting it all together
* `src/types.ts` - base data types
* view:
    * `MainView` - three.js main scene, lights, camera
    * `ObjectView` - drawing things and other objects on screen
    * `AssetLoader` - loading and constructing the game assets (textures, models)
    * `ThingGroup` - instanced meshes for optimized rendering of many objects
* game logic:
    * `World` - main game state
    * `Thing` - all moving objects: tiles, sticks, marker
    * `Slot` - places for a tile to be in
    * `Setup` - preparing the table and re-dealing tiles
        * `src/setup-slots.ts`, `src/setup-deal.ts` - mode-specific data for slots and how to deal tiles
* network:
    * `server/protocol.ts` - list of messages
    * `BaseClient` - base network client, implementing a key-value store
    * `Client` - a client with Autotable-specific data handling

Some terminology:

- **thing** - all moving objects: tiles, sticks, marker
    - **thing type** - tile/stick/marker
    - **thing index** - a unique number
- **slot** - a space that can be occupied by a thing
    - **slot name** - a string identifying the slot in game
- **seat** - table side (0..3)
- thing **rotation** - a 3D orientation, usually represented by Euler angles
- **place** - information about thing's position, rotation, and dimensions
- **shift** - moving things that currently occupy the destination when dragging; used e.g. when sorting tiles in hand and swapping them
- **collection** - a key-value dictionary stored on the server, a game state consists of various collections
